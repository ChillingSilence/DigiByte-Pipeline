# Dividends for DigiAssets

### Submitted by
@ChillingSilence

### Bounty details
Private arrangement between @ChillingSilence and developer for completion of the project, funded by @ChillingSilence

### Is this being worked on?
Yes, by @cept72

### Specifics
DigiAssets needs an easy way to pay dividends to users. This will be an independent website that is open-sourced as well as being hosted.

Users should be able to enter in an AssetID, enter an amount of $DGB to be distributed, and based on the percentage of the total supply that an address holds, it will get the same portion of the DigiByte being distributed.
